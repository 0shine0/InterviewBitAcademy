Design facebook news feed

Users
Posts
Friends (U1 ---  U2)

Facebook feed loads faster by caching. How to design the caching?
	1- Publisher- Subscriber model in case of normal user
	2- Pull in case of celebrity post(Page)


	Recent post of 1 month
	We can keep post_id of friends and can fetch, but we will have to fetch from 1000 machine for that.
	Cache
	[user_id,post_id]
	We will cache only 10 recent posts for them, so that will be 1B * 10 * 1KB 

	Cache 1 - For three days recent days
	Cache 2 - For top 5 posts of all user

We keep images in nearest cdn to save it from round trips.
