Two Pointer
	1-Given sorted array find number of pairs such that A[i]-A[j]=k

	Approach- Put pointer at 0 and 1.

	2- Given sorted array find number of distinct configuration that have area less than B

	Approach- put pointer i at 0 and j at n-1
	while(i<=j)
		if(a[i]*a[j]>B) j--;
		else ans+=(j-i+1)*2 - 1;

	3- Given three sorted array a,b,c minimize the equation
		max(ai,bj,ck) - min(ai,bj,ck)

	4- Given sorted array return 1 if there is a subarray whose sum is k
		Initialize i=0 and j=0 
		if(sum[i...j]>k) i++; sum-=a[i]
		else j++; sum+=a[j]

	5- Given three prime p1,p2,p3 and an integer k, find first k smallest integer which have only p1,p2,p3 in their prime factorization

		i <- 0
		j <- 0
		k <- 0

		a[0]=0;
		min=min(a[i]*p1,a[j]*p2,a[k]*p3) //increase the index whose contender was minimum

		for removing the duplicates we can see the last inserted element as element are being inserted in sorted order
