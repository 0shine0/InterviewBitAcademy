Day 37: Advance git and MVC Architecture

Here is the tutorial link: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/

Branching, merging of the repository

	def checkout -b "log implementation" //it creates new repository
	git push origin log implementation


MVC 
	Model, view and controller
	In restaurant, 
	cook is the model,  So model has business logic and data, reciepes are the business logic. 
	view is the dish, view is what we see. view should only be responsible to pass on the data to controller and take the response.
	controller is the waitor. Interacts between backend and frontend. controller is very thin.
