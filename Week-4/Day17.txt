Hashing
	Chaining 
	Collision

	In java balanced red black bst is used if the hash value of two keys is same, so the searching a key is O(logn)

	1- Given a stream of number which have three types of queries
		a) + num 	add an instance of the number to array
		b) - num 	delete an instance of the number from the array
		c) q string of 0 and 1 : 0 indicate odd digit an that position and 1 indicate even digit, find number of numbers that is equivalant to that string

		use hash of decimal equivalent of string

	2- Subarray with sum 0
		Use prefix sum

	3- Longest subarray whose sum is k
		look for prefix-k in hashmap

	4- Given array of N element return 1 if it contains contiguous integers
										and 0 otherwise

	5- Length of longest continous sequence
		for i= min to max of array
			if(mp.get(a[i-1]))
				len1=mp[a-1]
			if(mp.get(a[i+1]))
				len2=mp[a+1]
			maxi=max(mxai,len1+len2+1)

		Approach 2- COunt the longest streak beginning from that element
		for i in array
			if(map.get(arr[i]-1)
				continue;
			else 
				c=0
				while(x is in map)	
					c++;
					x++;									

	6-Given N pairs of points, find the number of right angled triangle whose sides are aligned with x and y axis

		get two map for x axis and y axis
		if we are at point (xi,yi) we will count the frequency of xi and yi in map
		if it comes out to be n1 and n2, then our answer will be (n1-1)*(n2-1)

	Assignment
		1- Find if there is a sub-array with 0 sum
		2- Largest Continuous Sequence Zero Sum
		3- Longest Consecutive Sequence
		4- Given an array A of integers, find the index of values that satisfy A + B = C + D,
