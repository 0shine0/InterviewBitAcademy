Searching-2 

	1-Given a sorted array of permutation (1 to N-1) in which all element except one comes once and one element comes twice, find element coming twice.

	Approach- find the pattern, a[i]=i+1 before occurence of special integer
								a[i]=i

	2-Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the maximum value K such that there is no subarray in A of size K with sum of elements greater than B.
		Approach= use binary search of range of size and calculate sum of all subarray of size mid.

	3- A farmer has N stall which are at position a[i] given in array of size N.
	He has C cows. Maximise the minimum distance between any two cows.

	here mid will indicate the distance after which we will put the cows.

	if you need to find maximum distance here is the implementation details
		go for 
			while(high-low>1)
			{
				if(possible(mid))
				{

				}
				else
				{

				}
			}
				return low;

	4- Given N books having p[i] pages respectively, and M students, maximise the minimum number of pages each student canread, such that
	1- Allocation of books should be contiguous,
	2- Each student to get atleast one book.

	5- Given a number N find the smallest good base of N
		Good base  k is the base which can represent the N using all 1's 
					k>=2

		Approach- fix value of i in 1+M+ M^2 + ... + M^i

		i will run from 63 to 1
			if(1+M+ M^2 + ... + M^i < N) low = mid+1
			else if(1+M+ M^2 + ... + M^i > N) high = mid-1

(Important)
	6- Given a family of string in which s[0]=0
		s[i]=s[i-1]+ "0" + ~s[i-1]
		find kth character of nth string.

	Hint- Bit will change when we move to right.
