	Upload/View/Share Video
	Record Stats of videos(likes/dislikes)
	Add/View Comments

Scale 
	1.5 B User
	800 million daily user
	A user views 5 videos, total videos per second would be
		800M * 5/86400 = 46K videos/sec

	Upload: View = 1:200

	Storage
		every minutes - 500 videos
		size - 50 MB
		500 * 50 * 60 = 25 GB/sec

	Bandwidth 
		Upload
			500 * 60 * 10 = 300GB/min

Design Goals
	High Reliablity
	High Available
	Low Latency

Deep Dive
	System API
		upload_video
		video_title
		video_description
		video_content

	High Level Design

		Processing Queue : for encoding, thumbnail, etc
		Encoder : to generate videos in multiple format

		Where would videos be stored?
			Videos can be stored in a distributed file storage system like HDFS or GlusterFS.

		Read Heavy System
			We can use different server for reading the data.

		How can we build more intelligent cache?
			If we go with 80-20 rule, i.e., 20% of daily read volume for videos is generating 80% of traffic, meaning that certain videos are so popular that the majority of people view them; It follows that we can try caching 20% of daily read volume of videos and metadata.

		CDN
			Trending videos can be stored in CDN
