Load Balancer has job to route to right server.
	Ways to route traiff
		To route the traiff we can use (user_id%N)
			- what if we add one more device, then all user will have to reassigned.

			- Hash(user_id)--> server_id
				The table of this map will become big and it will not be able to fit in memory of load balancer

			-Consistent Hashing

			We have multiple hash values for a server so that if we add/remove a server than it get mapped evenally.

			We keep the map of start values and server,and go on to do upper bound.
