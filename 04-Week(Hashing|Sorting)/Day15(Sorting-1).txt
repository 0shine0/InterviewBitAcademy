Sorting
	Stable Sorting 
		1- Insertion sort
		2-	Bubble sort
			If in bubble sort instead of reversing two sized subarray, we reverse subarray of size three, what will be the pattern we will get after applying this type of sort.

			even position will be sorted , and odd place will be sorted

O(N) sorting technique
	Counting sort
		1- find frequency of all number 
		2- build cummulatative frequency array in reverse order (that is max to min)
		3- place element at N-CF[a[i]], CF[a[i]]--;

	Radix Sort
		Sorting based on digit
		Coding implementation

	Number of septeples such that (a+b+c-d)/e =f;

	Homework 
		Product of sum
